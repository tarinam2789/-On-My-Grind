# Web Development Lab 3 - *☕ On My Grind*

Submitted by: **Tarina Muna**

This web app: **This project is an interactive coffee quiz web app called **“On My Grind”**. It randomly displays a coffee drink name and prompts the user to guess its characteristics such as temperature, flavor, type of milk, and whether it’s blended, by selecting from a set of options. The user submits their answers by clicking a button that first checks the responses and highlights correct and incorrect inputs with different colors. After checking, the button changes to allow loading a new drink for another round. The app uses simple HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a clean and user-friendly interface that provides immediate feedback and encourages repeated play.**

Time spent: **2** hours spent in total
